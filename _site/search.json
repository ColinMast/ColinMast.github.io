    "text": "Hi Mom! You’re on my website now\nGrowing up in a small town in southern Wisconsin, I spent much of my childhood exploring the local forests. In 2022, I received my B.S. in Geography and Environmental Studies with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While there, I worked on several research projects, including mapping the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), assessing wildfire risk in the Sierra Nevada, and creating regional maps to promote sustainable forestry in Argentina. After graduating, I spent a summer conducting dendrochronology fieldwork in the Oregon Coast Range.\nIn 2024, I received my M.S. in Geography from the University of Oregon. My research focused on modeling forest landscapes using LANDIS-II. My thesis assessed how an experimental forest management plan may impact timber production, wildlife habitat, vegetative diversity, and carbon storage under climate change and interacting disturbances. I also collaborated with three groups of forest ecosystem modelers to compare the behavior and utility of three forest models (FVS BioSum, ED2, and LANDIS-II) for projecting the effects of climate change, management, and disturbance on West Coast forests. Finally, I worked with collaborators from IIASA and the USDA FS Northern Research Station to assess the sustainability and impact of timber production in Siberia under climate change.\nI am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Forest Science at Colorado State University. My research utilizes ground measurements from field campaigns and the USFS’s Forest Inventory and Analysis plot network, as well as large-scale LiDAR data, to train a Sentinel-2 model that will predict forest structure and composition in forests of northern New Mexico. This model will aid in treatment planning and monitoring within the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests. I am also building on previous modeling efforts to assess the impact of climatic departure, topography, fuel availability, heterogeneity, and connectivity on the extent of high severity wildfire in the Western United States."

During the fieldwork, we set up an automated weather station and drilled three ablation stakes into the glacier. This research aims to enhance our understanding of the glacier’s behavior and contribute valuable data on its role in the local water cycle. The findings will help inform city planners and land managers about the glacier’s contribution to water resources for surrounding communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis weather station will provide weather data for Hayden Glacier at a fine temporal resolution, supporting glacial modeling of ablation and water supply to Bend OR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew adjusting to their equipment loads at trailhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first leg of our journey was fairly flat, but downed logs in the Pole Creek fire made traversing the trail difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter camping for the night we left tree line and made our way to the glacier.

    "text": "Vary across a climatic gradient in Western US conifer forests\n\nHigh-severity wildfires are a growing concern in the Western U.S. due to climate-driven fire season expansion and increased fuel loading and continuity from decades of fire exclusion. However, it remains unclear how the relative influence of fuels versus climatic departure on high severity burn area vary across long-term climate gradients. We delineated CWD-defined climate regions (mesic, intermediate, xeric) and evaluated how fuel availability, heterogeneity, connectivity, topography, and climatic departure influence extreme (95th percentile) high-severity burn area in over 4,000 burned conifer watersheds from 1986 to 2024. Fuel variables were important across all regions but had the strongest effects in xeric watersheds. Short-term climatic departure (VPD during the month of ignition) was also an important driver in xeric systems but played a minor role in mesic forests. Conversely, long-term climatic departure (five-year CWD) was the strongest predictor in mesic forests, suggesting that multi-year drought is particularly influential in these infrequent-fire regimes. Our results demonstrate that the drivers of high-severity burn area vary predictably across CWD-defined climate gradients and highlight the need for region-specific strategies to manage large, high-severity fires.\n\n\n\nResearch in progress."

Given significant limitations on time and resources for implementing and monitoring fuel treatments, availability of up-to-date, accurate, high-resolution, and updateable data products characterizing forest structure and fuel conditions could make a meaningful contribution to strategic planning and monitoring of fuel treatments. To aid in fuel treatment planning in Northern New Mexico, we are developing geospatial data products characterizing forest structure and fuel conditions by training satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery using measurements of forest structure and fuel conditions derived from airborne lidar and forest inventory plot data.\n\n\n\nResearch in progress."

However, as fire models have been applied to increasingly diverse forest structures and as remote sensing technologies have advanced, a variety of methods for characterizing CBH have emerged. In this project, we summarize the primary approaches for CBH characterization using field observation, airborne LiDAR, and satellite-based machine learning models, highlighting their assumptions, scales, and limitations. We then apply these methods across 100 field sites within four forest types in northern New Mexico to evaluate how method choice and forest structure influence CBH characterization. These CBH measurements were then applied in Rothermel-based models to compare methodological effects on predicted torching indices.\n\n\n\nResearch in review."

However, drought risk is expected to increase during the twenty-first century, especially in the southern Coast Range. This may have important implications for the growth and recruitment of drought-intolerant species such as western hemlock and western redcedar. To investigate the potential affects future climates may have on species growth and recruitment, I am working with a group of researchers at the University of Oregon to model forest succession in the Coast Range using the forest landscape model, LANDIS-II.\n\n\n\nResearch in progress."

The effect of these cumulative changes on the ecosystem functions provided by boreal forests is difficult to predict.

One proposed resolution is the establishment of the Elliott State Research Forest (ESRF), designed to balance timber production, climate change mitigation, endangered species conservation, and recreation. Supported by the Oregon Department of State Lands and in collaboration with Oregon State University, this project contributed to the development of the ESRF’s forest management plan. At the center of this plan is the experimental comparison of land sharing, land sparing, and Triad management. Using LANDIS-II, we simulated forest successional processes, management activities, natural disturbances, and multiple climate trajectories to inform sustainable management strategies and compare trade-offs between these three conservation strategies.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-024-02041-5"
